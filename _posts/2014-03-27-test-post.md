[Kristian is an imposing](http://google.com) 6’10”, but he is so quick to smile and joke and it’s no wonder he was cast to play gentle giant Hodor. And unlike his on-screen persona, Kristian is quite talkative.

Your Legacy had the chance to sit down with the two actors at the official Blu-ray and DVD launch for the third season of HBO’s Game of Thrones on February 18, 2014.

We chatted about football (soccer to us Canadians), music, how both landed the biggest roles of their respective careers and much more.
