I was actually lucky enough to grow up with Wayne Simmonds and watch him develop into the incredible hockey player he is today. A lot of the things we did as kids and teenagers were directly related to sports and hockey.

## Combining Play & Practice

In high school, after school was finished each day, we used walk over to the community gym and play games that were fun and helped us develop our hockey skills. There is one game in particular that Wayne and I used to always play that has been foundational to his ability to be so effective in front of the net on a power play. 

One of us would stand 20 feet away from the hockey net with a bunch of tennis balls as the other stood in front of the net ready to deflect the shots. The key was that you could only use a regular hockey stick, no hands, to defend the net. We would alternate who shot, taking 10 a piece, and the winner would be the one who scored the most goals.

We played this game every day for hours as we waited for our parents to pick us up after work. It was incredible for building our hand eye coordination and essential to Wayne's famous ability to deflect 90mph shots into the net. Our enthusiasm and the amount we played this game definitely contributed to Wayne’s development. And it has been a lesson to me in both perseverance and the value of enjoying what you do.
