<p>The rapport between Kristian Nairn and Isaac Hempstead-Wright is light and convivial off the set, it’s easy to see how the two characters they portray in HBO’s Game of Thrones – Kristian’s Hodor and Isaac’s Bran – work so well together. </p>

<p>Kristian is an imposing 6’10”, but he is so quick to smile and joke and it’s no wonder he was cast to play gentle giant Hodor. And unlike his on-screen persona, Kristian is quite talkative.</p>

<p>He physically dwarfs his counterpart, child-actor Issac; but Isaac keeps up just fine in a conversation. </p>

<p>Your Legacy had the chance to sit down with the two actors at the official Blu-ray and DVD launch for the third season of HBO’s Game of Thrones on February 18, 2014.</p>

<p>We chatted about football (soccer to us Canadians), music, how both landed the biggest roles of their respective careers and much more. </p>

<p>Read on for an exclusive glimpse into the lives of two of the most unique actors in television.</p>

<p>Your Legacy: Today is the official release of the third season of Game of Thrones. Are you guys excited?</p>

<p>Kristian: Seems like a long time since it’s been on TV. A year, almost? I can’t wait to see all the special features and stuff that we helped them make. It’s quite a detailed pack </p>

<p>YL: Isaac, I want to ask you: You’re 14 years old, you’re on a killer show, what’s it like at school?</p>

<p>Isaac: It’s just like, ‘oh, well Isaac’s gone off to do a bit of this, yada yada’ and then I get back and it’s straight back into school. It’s actually my teachers who tend to be more excited. I’ll come in one day and I’ll be debating with my English teacher about what’s just happened in the most recent (episode). </p>

<p>YL: What’s it like with your friends, do they introduce you as the kid from Game of Thrones? </p>

<p>Isaac: Sometimes (my friends) will ask for autographs for their friends. It’s quite cool. </p>

<p>YL: How about the dating situation? Have you noticed the call for dates go up exponentially?</p>

<p>Isaac: It hasn’t helped in the way I was hoping, actually. </p>

<p>YL: How can we help with that?</p>

<p>Kristian: You’re beyond help, I think.</p>

<p>YL: Kristian, you have to carry Isaac around all episode. What’s that like?</p>

<p>Kristian: It’s tiring; I’m not going to lie about that. He’s grown so much since season one. It’s all about method acting: It’s easy to look tired when you actually are tired. After 60 takes … I actually am tired. </p>

<p>YL: Because you carry him around half the day do you get pay and a half?</p>

<p>Kristian: I do not. I just get the half.</p>

<p>YL: What’s your chemistry like when you’re on set? How do you guys maintain not wanting to kill each other?</p>

<p>Isaac: Yeah, we hate each other. We’ve had, actually, several different fights and we’ve had to be separated. We’ve had riot police in; it’s been pretty chaotic.</p>

<p>YL: Who wins the fights?</p>

<p>Kristian: Him</p>

<p>Isaac: Me, yeah. </p>

<p>Kristian: No, we get on very well.  Obviously we’re in very close proximity.</p>

<p>Isaac: When you’re shoved that close to someone you’re either gonna -- like Marmite – actually, will you get that reference? Do you have Marmite here? It’s a British thing.</p>

<p>Kristian: It’s like a yeast extract you put on your toast. </p>

<p>Isaac: Their slogan is you either love it or you don’t. </p>

<p>Kristian: It’s extremely subjective. </p>

<p>Isaac: Actually, I don’t love it or – anyway … What was I talking about?</p>

<p>YL: Kristian, I know you love music. You love DJing. If you had to pick one song to spin at the HBO Game of Thrones party – say it was tonight; what song would be your go-to. </p>

<p>Kristian: Would it have to be Game of Thrones themed?</p>

<p>YL: It could be any song you want. </p>

<p>Kristian: I’m really feeling London Grammar, at the moment. They’re obviously from London. There’s a fantastic song called “Hey Now” and it’s just beautiful. You should check them out. </p>

<p>[To Isaac] Do you like London grammar? Do you know them?</p>

<p>Isaac: Yeah, I saw them on …</p>

<p>Kristian: I don’t believe you.</p>

<p>YL: I know you’re really busy onset for HBO’s Game of Thrones; how do you find time to DJ?</p>

<p>Kristian: I just make time. Honestly, I’m my own worst enemy sometimes. I just try to do as much as possible and I sacrifice my sleep quite a lot. Isaac’s Mum is always having a go at me for not sleeping. But, yeah, I don’t sleep very much. </p>

<p>YL: What’s your favourite gig that you’ve done?</p>

<p>Kristian: Actually, funny enough, last time I was in Toronto I did like a manga anime convention at the Japanese culture centre and it was just a roomful of raving anime fans and it was just incredible. The energy was fantastic. That was one of the best gigs I’ve ever done.</p>

<p>YL: Isaac, how did you get into acting at such a young age? What age did you start at?</p>

<p>Isaac: I was ten when I got the pilot and it was a complete accident. I used to go to a football club on a Saturday morning and I found it too cold so I was looking for something else to occupy myself at the weekend and there was a local drama group that my friend knew about so I went along. </p>

<p>I had a great time because we did all these drama games which were really good fun…</p>

<p>Kristian: It wasn’t too cold?</p>

<p>Isaac: It wasn’t too cold for those, it was nice and warm until I got to Game of Thrones and I was cold again and Game of Thrones was doing an open casting, which means they go around, they send a wide callout so anyone can go out and audition and the drama teacher put me and a couple other kids up and I got the role. The probability must have been vast.</p>

<p>YL: That happens. Sometimes you just fall into something you love. How about yourself, Kristian, how did you get into the role as Hodor?</p>

<p>Kristian: My journey started with music and performance, live stage performance and I auditioned for a Simon Pegg movie called “Hot Fuzz” … five years previous to Game of Thrones. Nina Gold, who is a casting director, she remembered my audition. She brought me back and it kind of goes to show there is no such thing as a bad audition because I thought I did a terrible audition for “Hot Fuzz” but I was right for a different part. </p>

<p>That’s one of my biggest points … there really is no such thing as a bad audition because look what happened.</p>

<p>YL: What we do with every interview is we allow one of our Twitter followers to answer a question. And one of our followers would like to know if you have ever considered switching roles and having Isaac carry you, Kristian, and if not what would it take to make that happen?</p>

<p>Isaac: 12 million pounds, I think and we can do it.</p>

<p>Kristian: Yeah, you’d be broken, but. </p>

<p>Isaac: But I (could) afford surgery!</p>
