We know, it’s a shocker - not everyone online cares about what you ate for lunch this afternoon. What your followers do care about is your business and how your products and services can benefit them; You can convert these followers into valuable leads...We’re here to show you how with these 5 simple steps!

1. Brand Your Profile Photo

Your profile photo should be a consistent image of your brand. It should showcase your logo & designated brand colours so your viewers know the association with your brand as soon as they see it.

2. Update your cover photo

This is the first thing your viewers will see when they visit your page (it’s the largest image), all the more reason to make it the most impactful. You can leverage cover photo in two major ways: 
- Show the personality of your brand. 
- Advertise your products or services and as a call to action (CTA).

3. Link your website URL in the “About” section of your profile

More often than not the people landing on your page are new followers/customers. This might mean that they may not know your website URL or that one exists at all. Providing your website URL gives them an easy, one click way to visit your website for more information, which in return for your business creates more website traffic…this equals sales.

4. Engage, Don't Broadcast. 

Growing up, we’ve all been told what to do, whether it was from our parents or older siblings. The last thing your followers want is to be told to do something. Engage with your followers through your content, create conversation, and build relationships. If you can connect on a personal level, they’ll go where you want them to. If you demand them elsewhere, they will most likely move on.
