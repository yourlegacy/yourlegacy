Canadian Music Week. AKA The [CMW](http://cmw.net). "What is it?" I asked myself, having never heard of it before. Can the team at Your Legacy Inc. get free media passes to experience everything? It turned out to be a yes. At that point, I officially realized I made it as a journalist, although that was never my plan. With media passes in hand (or technically on wrist), Your Legacy Inc. got behind the scenes access to the pop Canadian Music Week showcase at the Comfort Zone on May 8th. Yes, that included soundcheck and it was awesome.

The purple wrist band (that physically couldn’t be loosened) was placed on my right wrist, and tightened to the point that my right hand started losing blood circulation. I’m no doctor (yet…) but I know that when my hand starts turning purple, I’ve got a problem. The wristband was also long, identifying the CMW [social](https://www.facebook.com/canadianmusicweek) [media](https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianMusicWeek?feature=watch) [accounts](https://twitter.com/CMW_Week).

This was a nice touch, except it limited certain things that I can do with my right hand. This included my inability to wipe my butt. Cooking was a hassle as the band kept falling into the pan. Why didn’t I cut off the end of the wristband? Because...let’s just delve into the music. 

Having access to the pop showcase was a great experience. I’m not big on concerts because I don’t enjoy standing for hours on end or hanging out in a mosh pit with sweaty people (I get enough of that in a sauna). On occasion, I do enjoy live music (I saw Chromeo at the Danforth Music Hall). Anyway, I caught pop acts [Dorine Levy](http://dorinelevy.com), [Jasmine Singh](http://jasminesinghmusic.com), [Anastasia A](http://www.anastasiaamusic.net) and [ByStarlight](http://www.604records.com/604/home/artists/bystarlight-0). 

I’m not going to lie; I love hip hop, R&B, Latin and Cuban salsa music (although I don’t understand a word of Latin and Cuban music, or on occasion hip hop). I’m not huge on pop either, although I do indulge in Lady Gaga and Katy Perry from time to time. Going into the Comfort Zone, I didn’t know what to expect. Showcasing is a big deal; you get A&R from different music companies checking you out like me checking out girls out on Okcupid. 

The Canadian musician I listen to most is Drake, followed by Chromeo, so I didn’t expect to enjoy the showcase as much as I did. Generally at a concert, I prefer knowing the music going in, so I can sing along, bop my head, and not look like some asshole. 

But I was blown away by Dorine Levy as she was simply awesome. Coming through Tel Aviv by way of Montreal, Levy is an indie pop artist with the catchy tune “There for me.” Yes Dorine, I was there for you (during your show).

Next up was Jasmine Singh, another singer who was accompanied by a guitarist that resembled a musical Ryan Gosling. Together they put on an awesome show. They were nice enough to take a moment to chat and take a picture with me (Justin was a little camera shy). I almost asked fake Ryan Gosling for an autograph, but the rum hadn’t kicked in yet.

Singh was supposed to be followed by STAMPS, another indie pop band, but they were a no show, like a vampire’s reflection of a mirror. This gave the audience, but really me, an hour to relax their ears as the bass had my head ringing like a 1980’s phone switchboard. I also got another rum and coke.

Around 11pm, Anastasia A was up. A.A., as I and probably no one else calls her, did the longest set, which included 9 songs. I’m not going to lie; I met her before and listened to some of her songs. I’m a sucker for sappy love songs, and [“My Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1dG_gQr5_U) was my favourite going in. It had the vibe of Justin Timberlake’s “My Love” from a few years ago but without T.I. The song also made me want to experience being in love again as my heart was stirring like an overweight lady stirring cake mix. Jokes aside, it touched my heart and made me wish I could find true love. Unfortunately, there might be plenty of fish (in the sea or online), but they aren’t enticing. [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQRVd767hAQ).

Anastasia’s performance was the best of the night, as she rocked the set and had great stage presence and show(wo)manship. With the help of her backup singer Taya Marquis (with who I may or may not have a crush on), these two rocked the house. Or condo, because they were performing downtown.

I’m like 2Chainz, in the sense that when I talk, there is “No Lie.” I even yell “Truuuuuuu” after some statements, like “that shawarma was awesome. Truuuu.” And this showcase was truuuuly awesome.

Where was I? My point is that sometimes showcases don’t bring in much of an audience. It’s usually people passing by the venue, family, friends and fans. The Comfort Zone wasn’t at capacity between 9pm till 11. But when Anastasia went up, there was at least 150 people in the room. It’s safe to say that not only did she bring the house down, but the dwellers as well.

Ana definitely brought the triple F's: friends, family and fans. Why was I so aware of the audience? There was a beautiful blonde women with a dress that said “I want you to look at me. I know you’re looking, and I like that you’re looking. But I don’t want you to know that the only reason I’m wearing this dress is because I like it when strangers make eye and boob contact with this form fitting fabric I have on.” The dress was so tight I thought she grabbed it from the children’s section of Forever 21. What I’m saying is that I fell in love, with this attractive stranger, but also with Canadian music. 

Canadian musicians have a lot to offer and are very talented. I definitely became a fan of Dorine Levy, Jasmine Singh, Anastasia A and ByStarlight. Will I buy there music? Maybe. Will I illegally download it? Definitely not (or will I?). Now that I’m more experienced with what Canadians have to offer, and their talent level, I’ll be actively looking for Canadian musicians and relying less on Songza.
