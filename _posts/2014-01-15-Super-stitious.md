Isn’t it strange how successful people have strange superstitions? Do you ever wonder why? Does superstitious behaviour help at all? I’m not sure but it sure is interesting since it’s a socially accepted form of insanity.

Superstitious behaviour increases your confidence, no matter what you’re doing, whether it’s a first date, a sports game or a job interview. Before going into a job interview I always wear my lucky socks. Has it worked so far? Unfortunately not as I still work at a job I don’t particularly enjoy. 

But hey, it works for other people so it could work for you. Need further proof? Check out these successful people who were very superstitious (and very, very successful).

## 1. Wearing Shorts Under Shorts – Michael Jordan

It’s a common known fact that Michael Jordan, considered the greatest basketball player of all time (sorry Kobe and LeBron), wore a second pair of shorts underneath all of his game day shorts. While playing for the Chicago Bull and later the Wizards, Jordan would wear his blue shorts from his North Carolina days for every single game. 

The greatest player of all time, wearing two pairs of shorts? Sounds crazy. Sounds superstitious. Did he need more luck? He was the best. But I guess even the best of the best could use a little competitive advantage from time to time. Or for Jordan, all the time.

## 2. Skating Backwards – Patrick Roy

Patrick Roy, one of the greatest goalies ever in the NHL and current head coach and Vice President of the Colorado Avalanche, would skate backwards before every game. Roy has played for 18 years in the NHL and won the Conn Smyth Trophy three times so he did something right. But can you imagine how many times he completed his ritual. I’d do the math but I’m too lazy. Let’s just say it’s a lot — a crazy lot.

Another fun Roy fact; he’d converse with the goal posts. Yes, it sounds crazy but you can’t argue with the results. But you can argue with goal posts.

## 3. Playoff Beards – Everyone In All Sports

A playoff beard isn’t a person but it’s an incredibly superstitious act that entire teams partake in. A NHL playoff tradition practiced by players league wide, it’s basically the act of not touching your facial hair until either you are victorious in the Finals and are awarded the Stanley Cup or are eliminated from the finals. Basically you trade your looks for some luck. This might sound crazy but it creates team solidarity and confidence. 

Also, according to science, beards make men look 37% more desirable and 17% more intimidating. This trend is so popular that even players in the minors and high school leagues take part in it.

## 4. Drinking Your Own Urine – Lyoto Machida

Sometimes drinking your own urine seems like a good option, but only when it’s a last resort. Maybe you’re stuck in the wilderness and you’re out of water. Or a buddy bet you $20 to do it (hey, I’m not judging. The economy is in a rut.) But Lyoto Machida, former Middleweight champion in the UFC and spiritual successor of the Karate Kid, drinks his urine every morning. 

Why, you ask? Because he picked it up from his father who stated it helped to rid him of his cough. Does it work? Maybe, but Machida has had a storied legacy as a MMA fighter and was a former champ, so it seems like a yes. His father is also a qualified badass and martial artist. Next time you’re thirsty and unsuccessful, why not try drinking your own urine. It could change your life.

## 5. Wearing The Same Tie - Wayne Simmonds 

You might notice Wayne Simmonds is on the splash page. So clearly, he's a successful man. But what makes him so successful. Is it the years of hard work? Dedication to his craft? Natural athleticism combined with practice? Is it a rabbit's foot? Or maybe it's the fact that he wears the same tie everyday on a winning streak. It's probably not the latter but I'm not a scientist so I can't verify. Nonetheless, its still very superstitious. See, even NHL players are superstitious. 

Maybe superstitions are real. Maybe they aren't. But most people think it helps, whether it's in sports, work or any other aspect in life. So why not take part and have your own superstition? What do you have to lose?
