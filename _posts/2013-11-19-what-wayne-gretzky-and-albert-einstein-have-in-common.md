At first glance Albert Einstein and Wayne Gretzky seem to be two very different people. Einstein, being a world renowned theoretical physicist that changed the world of modern physics; and Gretzky, being the greatest hockey player to have ever played the game. Successful people have many common traits but most are taken for granted and are overlooked. As different as you think they may be, they have far more similarities than meets the eye. Understanding the connections between two succesful people can help us understand the patterns of success and provide us with insights that anyone can use to improve their own lives.
 
## Groundbreaking Accomplishments

The first and most obvious similarity is that both of them were at the top of their profession and had a profound impact on it. Both have achieved incredible awards, accolades and much, much more so here is brief list of what they’ve individually accomplished:
 
## Albert Einstein’s Awards and Accomplishments

- Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1921
- Awarded the Copely Medal of the Royal Society of London, 1925
- Awarded the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute, 1935
- He developed his most famous equation e=mc2 which explains the relationship between energy, mass, and the speed of light
- He explained that light energy came in chunks or quanta, now called 'photons'. This explanation changed the way researchers thought about the nature of light.
- He discussed the Brownian motion that helped in proving the existence of molecules
- He also gave forth explanation regarding the dynamics of individual moving bodies
- And last, but not the least, he explained the nature of space and time
 
## Wayne Gretzky’s Awards and Accomplishments

- 4 Stanley Cups
- Most total career points (3,239)
- Upon retirement held/shared 61 NHL Records
- Hockey Hall Of Fame 1999 Inductee
- Hart Memorial Trophy (most valuable player) — 1980–87, 1989
- Art Ross Trophy (scoring champion) — 1981–87, 1990, 1991, 1994
- Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff most valuable player) — 1985, 1988
- Lester B. Pearson Award (outstanding player, voted by the players) — 1982–85, 1987
- Lady Byng Memorial Trophy (sportsmanship) — 1980, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1999
- NHL Goal Scoring leader 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, now the Maurice Richard Trophy
- Lou Marsh Trophy (Canadian athlete of the year) — 1982, 1983, 1985, 1989
- Olympic Gold - Hockey (as Executive Director-Manager) 2002
 
## Burning Desire and Undeniable Passion

Einstein and Gretzky had a burning desire for what they were passionate about. Both committed their life to what they loved.
 
Gretzky started skating at the age of 3 and would spend 4-5 hours per day practicing with his brothers on a rink their father built for them in the backyard. It was clear that at a young age Gretzky’s passion for hockey was undeniable. When he was six, he was playing against 10-year-olds. Gretzky says, "All I wanted to do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out"
 
Einstein had a passion for understanding how the universe worked.  When he was five years old, he received a compass that sparked his fascination on how the needle always pointed in the same direction no matter which way he turned it. "That experience made a deep and lasting impression on me," he wrote years later. "Something deeper had to be hidden behind things." By the age of 12 he knew he wanted to spend his life studying how the universe worked. He would spend hours each day dreaming about light and how the universe worked.
 
## Unique Vision and Ability to Dream

Both great men had a special unique vision for their passions. Gretzky could see the ice like no other player and Einstein could see the universe like no other physicist.
 
Gretzky has a special gift for always seeming to know where the puck was going to go. He could see plays develop before they happened and would always be where the puck was going instead of where it was. This was a major contributing factor to him being able to score and set up goals with such ease.  His success relied on his ability to see to visualize the game on the ice: "Basically, I had to play the same style all the way through. I couldn't beat people with my strength; I don't have a hard shot; I'm not the quickest skater in the league. My eyes and my mind have to do most of the work."
 
Einstein had a similar yet uncanny ability to visualize. He began his theory of relativity while he daydreamed about riding a beam of light. While working as patent clerk he would spend hours staring out the window dreaming about the universe. For Einstein, daydreaming allowed ideas to flow into his mind with ease. It was his vision that would profoundly change the way the universe was understood. "Imagination is more important than knowledge," he once said. "Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
 
## Celebrity Status

Einstein and Gretzky were both "rockstars" in their perspective fields.
 
Gretzky was and still is today a household name across the world. Everywhere he went - and goes - swarms of countless fans would appear wanting to catch a glimpse of "The Great One." He understood his responsibilities as a star and would not refuse an autograph request, "For that person, that kid, it could be the greatest thing that ever happened to him," Gretzky said.  He was involved in one of the biggest blockbuster and shocking trades in the history of professional sports when he was traded the LA Kings in 1998. His stardom also gave him the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live twice.  
 
Einstein’s fame spread worldwide in 1919 when scientists observed that the position of the stars appeared to shift slightly as their light curved around the Sun, confirming Einstein's theory. He was instantly a worldwide celebrity. He was mobbed wherever he went. "I have become rather like King Midas, except that everything turns not into gold but into a circus," he said
 
## Legends

Gretzky and Einstein have forever become iconic symbols. Gretzky’s domination helped him re-write the record books and was partially responsible for the NHLs growth in popularity in the United States. Einstein, on the other hand, has forever changed the way we view the universe and understand physics.
 
 
## In The End

Successful people have many things in common. It is not the passion or profession you choose that is important, it is the commitment to your craft and mindset that matters.
