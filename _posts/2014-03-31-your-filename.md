How To Have A Restful Sleep and Wake Up Feeling Like A Million Bucks

How do you wake up in the mornings? I bet it involves a loud and annoying alarm going off. Then it involves you lumbering like a zombie to turn that alarm off, as if you not hitting snooze as soon as possible would lead to a bomb going off.

Aren’t you tired of that? Don’t you want to wake up on your own terms. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could program yourself to wake up at any given time, without using an alarm?

I do, but I’m not sure how to get there. Apparently, 1Plus12 CEO Glenn Estrabillio has identified 3 steps you can take to improve your sleep and wake up without an alarm, whenever you want.

Estrabillio’s steps are simple. Remove all the electronics in your room, mentally select what time you want to wake up just as you’re nodding off and eliminate television (at least before you sleep because lets be honest, no one is missing Game of Thrones).

 Make sure to check out Glenn’s video for the in depth look of the 3 simple steps you can take to make these changes. 

Don`t forget to let us know if his steps helped you wake up feeling like a million bucks.
