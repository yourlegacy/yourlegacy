Hey you! Ya, you. Come closer. Ok, now listen up.

Want to know how to be extremely productive? You think you’re already productive, but here at Your Legacy, we’ve uncovered 3 simple steps that will increase your productivity so much that it’ll be like having a twin around.

## 1 - Don’t Masturbate In The Morning

“But Your Legacy, I don’t masturbate in the mornings!” said the boy and/or girl that cried wolf.

Don’t act like you’re shocked. We all do it.  How much time do you spend going at it in the morning? 5 Minutes? 15 Minutes? 30 Minutes? Depending on your stamina (mine is Herculean), you’ll be at it for a while.

How many times have you burnt your eggs because your private parts needed attention. How many times have you missed the bus? How about the train? We bet it’s a lot.

Next time you wake up, regardless of how much morning wood/lady wood you’ve got, ignore it and just start your day.

## 2 - Quick Exercise Circuit

Exercising first thing in the morning is rough. I don’t know how people go for 10k runs in the morning before having breakfast, or do fasted cardio.  When I step out of bed, I’m like Windows 8: I’m barely functioning. 

My morning routine is as follows: make coffee and empty my bowels. 
However, I do find that if I get my heart pumping and blood flowing, I’m more alert. So either before I grab my coffee or right after, I drop down and do 15 push ups, 15 squats and 15 lunges. This gets my blood flowing and wakes me up quicker than the coffee.  

According to science done by the University of Barcelona, coffee kicks in after 10 minutes. Previous studies revealed that it takes between 30-45 minutes for coffee to take effect.

Bypass that and wake up with this mini-circuit.

## 3 - Cold Shower

There are countless studies that demonstrate the impacts of a cold shower: metabolism increase, muscular therapy, improved blood circulation and so much more. 

For the sake of this article, I conducted a cold shower experiment, climbing into the shower first thing in the morning and turning the shower temperature from “Cold” to “My ex-girlfriend’s heart.” 

I concluded that, even without any health benefits, the freezing temperature hitting my naked, muscular & immaculate body (ladies…) immediately woke me up. It was similar to having a double shot of espresso.

Another great thing about cold showers first thing in the morning: cuts out the needs to masturbate.
