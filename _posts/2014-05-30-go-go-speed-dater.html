<p>Stepping out of your comfort zone is key in order to grow as a person; that, or lots of cheesecake. By playing it safe, you can never fully experience what life has to offer. You want a raise? Can you leave your comfort zone and ask for one? See a cutie at the bar? Can you step out of your comfort zone? Don’t want to die alone? Are you willing to try speed dating? I was. I joined a speed dating event hosted by FastLife. </p>

<p>Speed dating is NOT mingling with singles while hopped up on methamphetamines. That’s one of the few things I learned while foraying into FastLife’s speed dating event in Toronto. What else can you learn from my experience at FastLife’s speed dating event in Toronto? Alot. Keep reading to get yours truly’s speed dating experience and learn what it takes to be a great speed racer...dater.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/speeddate/Optimized-speedracer-2.jpg" /></p>
<p class="center"><strong>The dates went just as fast.</strong></p>

<p>Why did I try FastLife’s Speed dating services? Because I don’t want to die alone. When I go out to bars in an attempt to meet single people, my batting average is low, not like Barry Bonds pre-steroids low, but low like the testosterone levels of a 39 year old man. It’s also getting harder to meet people in Toronto, so I decided to get creative. </p>

<p>Before trying FastLife, I forayed into the online dating world by creating an OkCupid profile. Oddly enough, my rate of success was lower than a Trinidadian limbo dancing champion. I couldn’t even tell you why my success rate sucked; I got zero dates. I’m not even sure how that’s possible because I’m awesome.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/speeddate/Optimized-the-lego-movie-awesome.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="center"><strong>Everything is awesome, including me.</strong></p>

<p>I have an outgoing, extroverted personality and I write for a living. This should be a recipe for success, at least when it comes to messaging strangers online. After being active online for two months and sending out more messages than the Canada Post office (well over 600), I was dateless.</p>

<p>It’s not like I’m ugly or a troll or anything; I’m often described as cute. My friend calls me Bradley Mini-Cooper because of my hair style and height. My personality has been referred to as charming and asshole-ish on different days by different people. Also, I tend to see eye to eye with women, as I’m relatively short. But I do have a few inches elsewhere... </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/speeddate/Optimized-Bobby.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="center"><strong>Not an ugly guy.</strong></p>

<p>My friends, both male and female, helped me craft my OkCupid profile. They even helped me with which pictures to use. Fun fact, don’t post a picture with your shirt off. Luckily for me, my chest hair negates that potential issue. After realizing how much time it was taking to read each profile (read: skim) and sending out personalized messages, I thought Speed Dating would be a better and more efficient approach. And I was right. </p>

<p>Fastlife seemed to be the #1 choice for speed daters in Toronto. The online reviews of the service were great as well. In 2013, Fastlife was even acquired by PlentyofFish (the world’s most popular online dating site), which guaranteed that there would be tons of attendees.</p>

<p>I reached out to Annabelle Parfitt, the CEO and co-founder of FastLife, informing her that I planned to attend an event and write about my experience as a speed dating virgin. She said that it was an awesome idea. She also introduced me to Neha Wadhwa, an event planner, who provided some tips for people looking to try speed dating. Obviously, I asked for the tips AFTER my speed dating event.  </p>

<p>On the night of the event, I pulled a Macklemore: “I walked into the club like what up I got a big c@*k, naw I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop.” There is one thing about that sentence that isn’t true, and the other one is arguable; I’ll let you decide on which is which.</p>

<p>The venue was The Ballet, located in the trendy Dundas Ossington neighbourhood. I arrived at 7:20, preferring to arrive slightly early to scope out the scene. What I was expecting was the scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYBo5eS5pW8">The 40 Year Old Virgin</a>.  </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/speeddate/Optimized-vlcsnap.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="center"><strong>Not what it was like.</strong></p>

<p>FastLife had rented out the entire floor, which made for an intimate affair. The venue has a rather large stage as well, and I was tempted to get up and introduce myself to the crowd. Ultimately, I decided against it. While looking around, I was greeted by the charming and friendly hostess, who introduced herself. I immediately forget her name as I’m wont to do.</p>

<p>She suggested I place my coat at coat check, which was a great idea since I did about 30 pushups before entering the venue and the jacket would only obstruct my pumping pectorals.</p>

<p>As people came in, I felt like I was in the NBA draft combine. Men were gazing at women, the women were checking out men. Everyone was analyzing each others appearance, attire, their vertical &amp; bench pressing ability. It was like a hyper version of what most single people feel like at a bar. I couldn’t help but smile; this felt like home and I was excited. The event was was called Successful Singles Speed Dating + Open Bar and was for men between the ages of 24-32, while the women ranged from 21-29. I'm a baby-faced 27 year old, but with a beard I actually look my age. And since the word <em>successful</em> is relative, I felt comfortable. I briefly spoke with “Mandrew” and “Mashley” before the hostess rang the bell and explained the details.</p>

<p>Everyone got a card with your name on it. During each date, you write down the name of the person you are with, and if you connect with them you mark off “yes.” Both parties have to say “yes” for you to receive each other’s email address the next day. The dates were 6 minutes long due to the time constraints of hosting 17 dates in total. Most importantly, the hostess stated not to talk about work. Seems easy enough. The bell rang and the dates began!</p>

<p>I had 17 dates with different people, which is probably more than most people have in a year. Almost all the dates were exciting; most people were interesting and the fact that you only had 6 minutes to conversate almost negated any possibility of having a boring date. I had only one date that was completely disinterested, which, statistically speaking, was bound to happen. </p>

<p>As an outgoing and funny guy, I was a little surprised. I wanted to get on the table and quote Maximus Aurelius. </p>

		<h4 class="margin-top">The Do’s</h4>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Just Relax</strong><br>
				Dating can be extremely nerve-racking, but FastLife’s goal is for everyone to have a fun night meeting like-minded singles in their city. Remember, everyone is in the same boat as you (call it The Love Boat), so just relax and be yourself! You only get 8 minutes and it flies by!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Ask Questions &amp; Listen To The Answers</strong><br>
				Ask “what do you like to do for fun” rather than “what do you do for work.” This opens up the conversation to a wide range of things you may find out you have in common instead of exchanging each other's work routine.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Dress To Impress</strong><br>
				Wear something that you feel the most confident in. Treat the event like it’s a first date because it is. Have some clean clothes and matching socks.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Say “Yes”</strong><br>
				You are meeting a series of different personalities so let your guard down. Let’s be real, saying “yes” to someone doesn't mean you’re marrying them. You never know who you can meet through them and you might even make a friend.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Good Hygiene</strong><br>
				You’re sitting close to someone in an intimate setting, so pack some mints or gum to ensure you have fresh breath. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Meet Everyone &amp; Be Open Minded</strong><br>
				This is the best mindset to have before going to your Speed Date. If you come across someone who you’re not interested in, don’t skip them. You’re at a dating event -- meet everyone with an open mind.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="pad bg-red white">
		<h4 class="margin-top">The Don'ts</h4>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Don’t Have Verbal Diarrhea (don’t only talk about yourself)</strong><br>
				Or have verbal constipation. Never talk about your ex-girlfriends/boyfriends on your speed date. You only have 8 minutes and no one wants to hear about your past relationships! Make your date feel like a star since you’re looking for compatibility. Give them full eye contact (eye contact, not thigh) and show interest by asking questions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Don’t Get Drunk</strong><br>
				Speed Dating is nerve-racking and a drink or two is always great to loosen up. Don’t take this too far as this is your first impression with a series of people whom you’ve never met before!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Don’t Ask Someone Their Age</strong><br>
				This is a huge no no on the first date, never ask a woman her age no matter what! There is plenty of time to figure this out in the future.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Don’t Be A Drill Sergeant!</strong><br>
				This isn’t an interrogation. It’s great to ask questions but wait to hear the answer before you move onto the next one. The goal is to have a conversation, not an interview!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Avoid Having The Same Conversation on each date</strong><br>
				Talk about something different on each date. Be creative.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Avoid These Heavy Topics</strong><br>
				Don’t talk about religion (unless it’s a specified religious event), politics, past dates, pick-up lines, news or sex. Or the weather. Never talk about the weather.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>DON’T TEXT</strong></p>
			</li>
		</ol>

<p>I decided not to as I didn’t want my evening to end like Maximus’ did. Throughout the evening, I was asked several times what I did for a living - a cardinal sin according to the hostess - by several dates. I really wanted to say “if I told you, I’d have to kill you” but thought that answer wasn’t in my best interest.  I never asked people what they did for a living because it seemed like a boring question. I opted for questions like: what’s your favourite movie, what’s your favorite color, do you think that most of the men wearing blazers today are doing so to hide their underarm perspiration? </p>

<p>For shits and giggles, sometimes I responded to the “What do I do for a living” question with a classic line that my friend Arya devised sometime ago; and the conversations went a little like this:</p>

<p><strong>Date</strong>: So what do you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: I help diabetic cats. They tend to not enjoy and consume the taste of insulin, so I came up with mittens that are pre soaked with insulin. Their paws easily absorb the medicine through cloth. It’s called Mittens for Kittens. </p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>Sexy Man</strong>: I swear. Mittens for kittens. It has nothing to do with the It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia episode. </p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: You’re kidding. </p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: I am.</p>

<p>I’d eventually let them know that I’m the Editor-In-Chief for Your Legacy Inc. That is slightly less interesting than helping diabetic cats through Mittens For Kittens but it's an answer I had to provide. </p>

<p>Most of my dates were really fun and entertaining. Some of my dates were genuinely like missiles, that is, engaged. The open bar most definitely helped people become more sociable and relax. In the end, I had three matches. At first, I thought the number was low. But then I figured that on a night out at a bar that there is no guarantee that you can meet people, so I figured that having three matches wasn’t that bad.</p>

<p>Would I recommend speed dating, particularly to Fastlife’s services. Definetly. Who should try it? Let me ask you in the format of a multiple choice question:</p>

<p>a) Single People</p>
<p>b) People that enjoy online dating but are afraid of potential stalkers</p>
<p>c) People that are tired of going to bars to meet people</p>
<p>d) Everyone</p>
<p>e) All of the above.</p>

<p>The answer is E. Go in with an open mind. Be friendly. Put on some damn cologne, but not too much (I’m looking at you, Iranians) and don’t talk about what you do for a living. Unless you make mittens for kittens. </p>
