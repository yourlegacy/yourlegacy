Life happens so quickly that sometimes we develop tunnel vision and miss the things around us that matter the most.

Being an entrepreneur, I am sometimes guilty of focusing solely on work and forgetting to enjoy and appreciate the people around me that I love. The ability to spend more time with my family and friends is so important to me. For Mother’s Day I made sure I did something extra special for my mom.

My mother and I had the pleasure of attending Mother’s Day brunch at the beautiful Casa Loma, a Liberty Entertainment Group property.  We had the joy of sharing our brunch with Canadian recording artist Anastasia A and her mom.
 
Our beautiful brunch was filled with tasty hors d’oeuvre, delicious entries, and incredible pastries. Even a few mimosas were served to celebrate a perfect day.

The staff and servers helped to create a first class dining experience in the majestic castle. After brunch, we took a tour of the historic site, where we were in awe with the intricate details of its rich history. My favourite part was travelling through all of the secret tunnels and passages.  Who doesn’t like feeling like an early 20th century James Bond. 

### Seeing the smile on my mom’s face is what made the whole experience a day I will never forget.
