Chris Austin Hadfield is a retired Canadian astronaut and also the first Canadian to walk in space. He’s also the epitome of awesomeness and manliness.  Why? He was an engineer, a former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot (he even piloted experimental planes) AND has flown three space missions. He also might be a Green Lantern.  In case Hollywood isn’t making a film based on his life right now, you should know that he served as commander of the International Space Station. If that’s not amazing enough, he came from Sarnia, a small town known for having the Canadian military come in to help during a winter storm.  

Hadfield was inspired to become an astronaut when he was nine years old, while watching the Apollo 11 moon landing. Talk about shooting for the stars. When I was 9, I was inspired to become a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. If you ever need inspiration, just think of Chris Hadfield: he was raised on a farm in a small town and literally shot for the stars. 

Chris Hadfield is basically the Canadian James Bond in Moonraker. If there’s one thing you know about Bond, James Bond, it’s his ability to...impress women. Here at Your Legacy, I’ve come up with a hypothetical online dating profile that an astronaut could have.

## An Astronaut's Dating Profile

**Job**: Asstronaut

**Employer**: NASA

**Motto**: Never Amount to Something not Amazing

#### Pickup Lines From Space

1. I helped install the Canadarm... So wanna see MY baby Canadarm?
2. I’m similar to an erection: Gravity can’t hold me down and I’ll blast off.
3. I’d sweep you off your feet, but I don’t want you floating away from me.
4. Not to quote Khal Drogo, but you’re the moon of my life.
5. Like the sun, you’re so hot and the only reason I can live.

#### 5 Awesome Reasons Why I Like Being In Space Even Though I’m Away From You... 

1. One of the benefits of space is the absence of gravity - you’re not compressed so you can become up to 2 inches taller AND longer...ladies... 
2. You don’t have to worry about your weight. Even Cosmos magazine doesn’t give you 13 steps to burn fat. 
3. There is no such thing as a bad hair day.
4. No need to dust or clean because of the vacuum of space. Just open your shuttle door once in a week.
5. Play rock, paper, scissors with the Canadarm.

**Bonus Reason No One Talks About**: No one can hear you fart in space. Also, in zero G, it could propel you forward (if you had a burrito).

#### Online Dating Profile - About Me

**What I Enjoy**: Long walks in space.

**About Me**: I’m a quiet guy & introspective, mainly because you can’t hear anything in space.

**Favourite Activity**: Not die in space. And play Xbox.

**Favourite Candy Bar**: Skittles. What, you thought I’d go with Milky Way or Mars bar?

**Favourite Movie**: Astronaut’s Wife; Charlize Theron is in it, enough said.

**Favourite Outfit**: A Spacesuit - mainly because it costs a ballerific $11 million. 

**Favourite Song**: “My Goodies” by the Black Eyed Peas. If I’m in a space shuttle, I’d be listening to Drake’s “Hold on, we’re going home.”

#### Space Investment Opportunities

Space tourism is a reality. Flying around and checking out the Earth and moon are great, but at some point, you’ll need some products & services. Coming back to Earth for the things you need would be hard, since it’s a loooooong flight back. At some point, entrepreneurs can bring the products and services to you… in space. At Your Legacy, we will be funding the 4 start-ups listed below.
