Canadian athlete Jenna Blasman is kicking ass and taking names, with her non-writing hand because she dislocated and broke her wrist during the winter Olympic qualifiers for the slope style team. What is slope style, you ask (yes, we know what you’re thinking)? It’s a mix of rails, ledges and jumps that athletes go down on and yes, it’s as crazy as it sounds. Slope style recently debuted for the first time at the Sochi Olympics.

Did a dislocated and broken wrist stop Blasman? No. She successfully qualified. Competing with an injury isn’t easy but it did result in something interesting; Blasman unintentionally created a trademark style due to the fact that she couldn’t fit a glove on top of her cast. She competed gloveless, earning her the nickname “The Gloveless Wonder.” Did we just create that nickname? Possibly, but Blasman’s style is cooler than Sochi’s weather so the nickname fits.

Maintaining a great attitude, Jenna was optimistic about her situation:  “I’m so happy that it’s just my wrist that got injured so I can fully ride. I got the okay from the doctors so I’m just crossing my fingers that I can make it to Sochi. I’ll ride with a broken arm if I have to.”

And she did just that. Endearing the international audience, Blasman quickly became a crowd favorite and somewhat of an underdog. Not too many Olympians compete with an injury, especially a gruesome one like Jenna’s, but that didn’t stop.

Although she didn’t win a medal in Sochi, Jenna definitely has the heart (and wrist) of a champion.
