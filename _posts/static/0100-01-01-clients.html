			<p class="h2">FAQ</p>
			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Will the likes come from real people?</p>
			<p>Yes our likes are from real users from around the world</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Will my follower/likes count ever drop off after some time?</p>
			<p>Remember, since there are real followers and likes, we canâ€™t control what these people do, but we always replace any followers that may drop off within 3 months. Just contact us. After that, it will be up to you to publish engaging content that keeps your audience coming back for more. </p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Do you post from my account? </p>
			<p>No, we will never post anything on your behalf.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Do you respect my privacy?</p>
			<p>Yes. We take privacy very seriously. We will never disclose your name, username, or any of your information to anyone.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Do you require my password? </p>
			<p>For Facebook, no. For Twitter, we do require your password because we have built software that allows us to efficiently build up your follower base and this software requires admin access to work securely. Once we have built up your follower base, you are free to change your password to anything you like â€“ in the meantime if youâ€™re not happy with our services for any reason, you can always reset your password via email.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">How does this process work?</p>
			<p>We have an extensive network of popular Facebook pages, websites, and PR contacts. Paired with our proprietary system, we can effectively promote your page to a wide audience. We will halt promotion once your page has met the quota that we've promised.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Are the followers targeted based on their interests?</p>
			<p>Yes. We target audiences based on your industry. Our standard services provide worldwide likes and followers; this means you may receive users from various countries. We try to promote your page to an English speaking audience, but ultimately, we cannot control what kind of people want to like your page.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">How long have you been in business?</p>
			<p>We have been in business for almost two years now. We have provided our services to celebrities, musicians, business sites, and even pro athletes.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Are these likes and followers added all at once?</p>
			<p>All of our campaigns are "drip-fed"; our social media services take some time. Real people cannot be fabricated overnight, beware of services that offer to do so.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Can I run a Your Legacy campaign with another third-party campaign simultaneously?</p>
			<p>Yes, but we don't recommend it. If you run two campaigns at once, weâ€™ll get credit for work we didnâ€™t do and thatâ€™s not how we like to do business. However, we do over-deliver on all of our orders to account for any organic likes you've received on your page during our campaign.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Why hasn't my order started?</p>
			<p>Our service is run by humans; please give us a couple of days to kick off your order, as we do have an order queue, and all pages are manually promoted. </p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Is this service safe to use?</p>
			<p>Your Legacy will have no negative impact on your account's good standing.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Can I split my order between multiple pages?</p>
			<p>Unfortunately we cannot split a single order between multiple pages. However, we do provide bulk discounts for these type of orders, reach out to us through our contact page with your goals, and we'll give you a quote.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Where can I see the status of my order?</p>
			<p>We will send a message to the email address specified during checkout when your service is completed. </p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">Do you offer custom packages? </p>
			<p>We can create a custom quote based on your need for all services including, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. You can order just one or any combination, whatever is best for your business is our goal.</p>

			<p class="h4 margin-bottom-0">How can I benefit from this service?</p>
			<p>Yes!Having very few "Likes" on Facebook and other social platforms can indicate that your product or website appears to be fairly new and not yet reputable. Your Legacy increases your overall number of fans and rapidly increases your social network visibility with our large network of visitors. Studies prove that an increased social presence can also benefit website rankings and brand exposure.</p>
