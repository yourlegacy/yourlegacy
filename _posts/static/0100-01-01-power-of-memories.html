		<p class="intro">Memories. Your entire life consists of them, they capture who you are &amp; what you’ve done but do you really understand them? How do memories work? </p>

		<p>Did you know you can use the power of memories to your advantage? Yes, you can create and use memories to improve your confidence &amp; success. Want to know how? Then send $9.99… Just kidding. Scroll down to see how you can use the power of your memories, like NHL star Wayne Simmonds has, to improve your future endeavours. </p>

		<h2>Is There Science Behind This?</h2>

		<p>Yes, behind it, beside it and in front of it.</p>

		<p>I’m not making this up. You can make the most of your experiences so that they will be remembered positively, therefore helping you perform the next time you’re doing something similar to it. Don’t believe us? Well, then listen to the words of Daniel Kahneman, the winner of the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic studies. Kahneman also co-founded the field of behavioural economics even though he’s a physicist. Don’t feel bad about your life though because, like Kahneman says, you can utilize the power of your memories to recall experiences positively.</p>

		<p>Kahneman’s research states that there are two defining moments that determine if a memory will be remembered fondly or not: the peak, and the final moments of an experience. Essentially, what happens in the final moments of an experience can potentially ruin or enhance the memory of that experience but not necessarily the memory itself.</p>

		<h2>Born This Way</h2>

		<p>Please don’t start singing Lady Gaga’s lyrics.</p>

		<p>If memories are recalled as being positive or negative based on the outcome during the peak and end of a memory, can we shape experiences into positive ones? The answer is yes. Who utilizes this technique? Highly successful individuals, including Wayne Simmonds of the Philadelphia Flyers. Who else, you ask? Slightly less successful individuals, such as myself.  </p>
		
		<p>Before you can access the power of memories, you need to know a little secret.</p>

		<h2>What’s the secret</h2>

		<p>What truly is the secret to harness the power of memories? It’s simple: be positive (unless you’re H.I.V. That’s the only time not to be positive...Unless you’re Magic Johnson. In that case, you’re clearly OK).</p>

		<p>Ever wonder why positive people seem to be more successful (and annoying)? It’s because positivity goes a long way.  Over the last few years, best-selling books like The Secret &amp; The Power of Now preach that maintaining a positive outlook and being optimistic can yield the results you desire.</p>

		<p>Although you might not get that Ferrari you keep wishing for or end up waking up next to Angelina Jolie (because Brad Pitt would kick your ass), the power of optimism can help you in a few ways.</p>

		<p>Firstly, having a positive attitude can impact everything from decreased feelings of loneliness (put down that tub of Ben &amp; Jerry’s, ladies) to pain tolerance. Yes, you can be an emotional Superman. What else? Evidence has shown that optimism is clearly associated with better psychological health, as seen through lower levels of depressed moods, anxiety and general distress when facing difficult life circumstance. So when life gives you lemons, as long as you’ve got a optimistic attitude, you can take those lemons and make lemon flavored Gatorade and kick life in the balls.</p>

		<h2>How To Apply This To Your Life</h2>

		<p>You want to know how Wayne Simmonds, Mr. NHL harnesses the power of his memories, don’t you? Well, before we get to that, how about I give you one of my experiences.</p>

		<p>When I was a much younger lad in high school, without my Zeus level beard and Herculean muscles, I had to approach girls to meet them. I basically got rejected more times than a Hannibal Lecter retrial. Due to this, I developed anxiety about approaching women because many of my experiences ended negatively (didn’t get the number, didn’t get the girl). Every time I entered a similar situation, my memories flooded back reminding me time after time that I sucked at this.</p>

		<h2>How did I improve this?</h2>

		<p>I did my best to end each encounter with a joke so that the girl would laugh. Whether I got the number or not didn't matter because it ended up being a fun conversation. After I did this a few times, my experience were recalled in a positive light, so when going forward I didn’t have social anxiety. </p>

		<p>What does Wayne Simmonds do? He utilizes what’s known as the Lemieux drill, coined after NHL legend, Mario Lemieux. The drill is simple: after practice, whether the last drill was shooting, passing or play reviews, Lemieux wouldn’t leave the ice until he had scored a goal. Why? So that when he recalled the memory of the practice, he’d remember scoring a goal and not botched plays or the shots he missed. By recalling the end of the practice, the goal became his positive marker on the experience. Wayne Simmonds does the same. No goal, don’t go home. It’s a simple technique that works.</p>

		<h2>So Now What?</h2>

		<p>Now you know the simple secrets that will allow you to use the power of positive thinking. Just remember, be positive. It’ll make you cope better with life and make you resilient. Also, remember that the peak and end of an experience forms whether the memories of said experience will be positive or negative. Whether you’re Wayne Simmonds practicing on an ice rink or an average desk jockey working the 9 to 5, end your daily experiences positively. Score a goal, give a colleague a high five or steal a stapler on your way out of work. You’ll form positive memories off of positive experience. If Wayne Simmonds and yours truly can use this secret, so can you.</p>
