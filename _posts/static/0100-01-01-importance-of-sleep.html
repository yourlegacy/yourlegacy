		<p class="intro">We all know sleep is important but when life gets busy it's often the first thing we sacrifice. Recent studies are revealing the extent to which skimming on our Zs is doing us a lot more harm than good. Read on to discover why losing sleep is the cornerstone of a losing strategy.

		<p>Sleep is so important when it comes to performing at our highest levels. Too often people sacrifice sleep which can be detrimental to their performance in both physical and mental activities. Here is why sleep is so important and can be used as one of your most powerful tools to achieve the success you want.</p>

		<h2>Sleep allows your body to rest, rebuild, and recover.</h2>

		<p>Proteins are essential for both your physical and mental success. When you are sleep deprived, you do not get your proteins folding properly. If the proteins are not folded properly they don’t have the proper 3D structure and can form clumps within a cell causing it to clog up. This is why you get drowsy. Sleep allows your body to clean up these clumps and toxins.</p>

		<p>This is important for athletes because it allows their muscles to recover and rebuild after an intense day of working their body. “Getting enough sleep is crucial for athletic performance,” says David Geier, MD, director of Sports and Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>

		<p>Cheri D. Mah conducted a study on the Stanford University varsity men’s basketball team in 2007 that tracked the correlation between sleep and performance. The results showed the players that added an average of 2 extra hours a night increased their speed by 5%, free throw accuracy by 9%, had faster reflexes and felt happier.</p>

		<h2>Maximize Sleep to Improve Performance</h2>

		<p>Mah’s tips to help athletes improve their performance by maximizing their sleep:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Prioritize sleep as a part of your regular training regimen.</li>			
			<li>Extend nightly sleep for several weeks to reduce your sleep debt before competition.</li>
			<li>Maintain a low sleep debt by obtaining a sufficient amount ofnightly sleep (seven to nine hours for adults, nine or more hours forteens and young adults).</li>
			<li>Keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same times every day.</li>
			<li>Take brief 20-30 minute naps to obtain additional sleep during the day, especially if drowsy.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A quality sleep also allows your brain to form connections from things you have learned that day. When learning and perfecting skills a good night’s sleep allows your brain to complete connections. Sleep washes away a lot of unimportant memory space filled up by small unimportant tasks.</p>

		<p>When we are sleep deprived, our attention and focus drift, making it more difficult to process information. Neurons become over-worked which causes chaos in your brain trying to coordinate information. Thus making it difficult to access stored knowledge, information, and skills.</p>

		<p>This internal confusion than permeates out into our physical world where we then lose ability to properly assess our surrounding environment and make correct and accurate decisions; that is a fancy way of saying your judgment becomes impaired. This has very obvious effects on day-to-day performance, especially in the lives of Pro Athletes.</p>

		<p>Without proper sleep, neurons do not fire well, muscles are not rested, and your body’s organ systems lose their ability to synchronize. This increases the chance of accident or injury, all very bad news to an athlete.</p>
		
		<h2>The Solution</h2>

		<p>Get a good night’s sleep. Many studies suggest around 8 hours of sleep per day. President of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, Jim Thornton, recommends that high level athletes should get an extra hour more of sleep per day than the average person. Professional athletes understand the importance of sleep to their success and follow specific sleeping routines to ensure they are always performing at their optimal level. If you are unable to get your 8 hours in, naps may just be your key to success. Sleep well my friends!</p>
