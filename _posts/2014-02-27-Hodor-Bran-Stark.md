Your Legacy recently had the chance to interview actors Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran Stark) and Kristian Nairn (Hodor) from Game of Thrones, to discuss the third season Blu-ray and DVD release (available as of February 18, 2014), as well as other interesting things (did you know Kristian is a famous DJ?).

The Your Legacy team entered the Four Seasons in Yorkville and headed up to where Isaac and Nairn were doing rounds of interviews. When it was our turn to speak with the actors, the YL team asked the difficult questions: the questions that fans have been dying to ask, the questions that have been shrouded in mystery since day one, the kind of questions that only George R. R. Martin might know the answer to.

Some journalists may have asked questions such as “How do you guys overcome the communication barrier when Hodor has a one word vocabulary?” We asked what the fans wanted to know. To Kristian, we asked “do you get half of Isaac’s paycheque because you carry him during every scene?”  The answer was sadly a no. To Isaac, we asked if “fame and fortune has increased your dating prospects?” You’ll be surprised by his answer. Make sure to check in later this week  for the full feature interview.

Since the crew at Your Legacy are big fans of the show, we should note that yes, Kristian is huge, standing at 6 feet and 10 inches. When he shook our hands, we felt as if we were shaking the hands of a giant, albeit a gentle giant. Isaac is also a very cool dude, and has visibly grown and matured since the beginning of the third season. As a matter of fact, when we wanted to take a picture with Isaac, we had to resist asking him to hang on our back (while in character) and pose.  Both Kristian and Isaac were kind enough to let the YL crew take pictures with them, even after we said how these pictures would help us get dates on Tinder and Match.com. “No amount of fame can help Isaac” said Kristian.
