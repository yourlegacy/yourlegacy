Whether it’s a big concert venue or small bar, you can catch your favorite artists all across the city this week. Now you don’t have to worry about where to take your date with that waiter or waitress you asked out - Canadian Music Week has you covered like poopie in a porta potty. 

In terms of comedic talent, Tom Green, Spencer Rice, Kenny Hotz, Sebastian Maniscalco and Miranda Sings will be performing. If you don’t like music (how could you not like music?), this is best alternative. 

The team at Your Legacy Inc.

Keep an eye out for our behind the scenes look at this show, as well as an exclusive interview with Anastasia A.  

Your Legacy Inc. got to briefly chat with Anastasia A before her show. Here’s what she had to say: 

> “I am looking forward to my CMW showcase this year and will be performing a brand new 40 minute set. I will also have my unreleased EP exclusively available to fans and industry professionals that night (May 8)! I always have such a great time at the summit and am looking forward to networking as well as catching up with all my team members and industry friends!”
